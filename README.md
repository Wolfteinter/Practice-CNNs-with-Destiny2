# Practice CNNs with Destiny 2 :earth_americas: :milky_way:
The purpose of this repository is practice design and construction of Convolutional neural networks(CNN) using a dataset created from Destiny 2 [website
](https://data.destinysets.com/) is expected 4 projects using the same datasets or derivatives,if you have any suggestions you can write to me

## Project 1
The objective of this project is the classification of the armors of Destiny 2 game in 4 types of armors using a Convolutional neural network(CNN)
* Arms
* Chest
* Helmet
* Legs

The model was trained in a GPU 1660 Super using Python 3.7.4 :snake:, Keras

The images are like this...

The plot of the training result is the next...

The accuracy in the test set was of 0.9578
